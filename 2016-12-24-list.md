# Interview Questions to practice

* Given a sorted array, find three values in the array that sum to a given number.

  e.g. Given `[1,2,3,4,5]`, can you find three values that sum to 10? If so, what values are they? The solution must be better than `O(N^3)`.

* Given a random Wikipedia article, how do you find the shortest possible way to reach the LiveRamp article by clicking the links on the pages? What data structures do you need? What if you had an API that gives you the list of links in a Wikipedia article? Space/time complexities? What if you didn't care about time complexity, but wanted to lower space complexity?

* Find `K`th smallest number in array of size `N` with `O(N)` time complexity.

* How do I know if a path exists between a start and end node in a large unweighted and undirected graph?

* Given two strings, what is the minimum number of steps you must take to change it into another string of the same length? Each step consists of changing one letter and the resulting word must be in the English language.

* Given a large set of folders, each named after an actor and each containing a list of movies in which he/she has performed, create a mapping from a movie to the list of actors in that movie. How do you do this optimally?

* Find shortest path between two nodes (Djikstra's?)

General tips:

* Depth-first/Breadth-first tree/graph exercises

* Data structures (linked lists, stacks, hash tables)

* Sorting algos
